  <h1>Digital-Twins for Sensing</h1>

  <p>Enabling Wireless Sensors via deisgning simulators, and novel perception models for aiding Next Generation Wireless Digital Twin models.</p>
  
  <p>To facilitate the seamless integration of wireless sensors into our everyday applications, a critical element currently lacking is the availability of expansive datasets and real-time integrations within simulators tailored for large-scale deployments and assessments. Drawing inspiration from recent strides in Digital-Twin technologies across diverse domains, my research is poised to take the next leap forward. This involves crafting a sophisticated framework for efficient perception, simulator design, and the delivery of real-time feedback from the digital twin of the simulator to real-world environments.</p>

  <p>For localization across all kinds of different environments for example we would need large models and larger datasets, Which demands for readily available RF-simulators, and the current simulators are still lacking. So, I would like to develop physics inspired ML models like the diffusion models to create wireless simulators that are closer to the real world scenarios. Which could help for a more wider deployment of these sensors by the design of ML-based digital twins by making them readily integrable into simulators like unity and gazebo</p>
